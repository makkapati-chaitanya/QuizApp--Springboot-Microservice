Quiz Application backend developed using Spring Boot microservices.  
The architecture includes:
- **question-service**: manages questions and categories  
- **quiz-service**: handles quiz creation and evaluation  
- **service-registry**: enables service discovery and registration  
- **API Gateway**: provides a single entry point for routing and load balancing  

Designed to demonstrate microservices-based architecture, scalability, and modular development.
